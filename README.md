# SokoMAD

A Sokoban clone developed while learning Go.

While learning Go, I wanted to program something to apply what I was learning. So look at this code with caution, it's not very well organized and probably not very Go-idiomatic, but it has been really fun to develop.

It only has 20 easy levels and 20 levels from the original game, because I got tired of adding more levels.
